### Hi there! I am Ian, an embedded systems engineer. I design circuits and write software.

I am known for maintaining a mirror of the ngspice source code here on Github, a Mandelbrot FPGA project that a lot of students probably steal, and a stack machine in Verilog. You might also find fun little projects for an STM32F4 demo board.

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an ASIC design utilizing the google skywater PDK.

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me: Make a pull request on one of my original repos. That would get my attention.

#### âš¡ Fun fact: I have a soft spot for VHDL.
